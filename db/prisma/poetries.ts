        "Fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen,",
        "And laughter where complaint had merrier been,",
        "Moans, shrieks, and curses, and blaspheming prayers",
        "Accosted us. We climbed the oozy stairs",

        "Whom we seek here?' 'Of his sad history",
        "I know but this,' said Maddalo: 'he came",
        "To Venice a dejected man, and fame",
        "Said he was wealthy, or he had been so;",
        "Some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe;",
        "But he was ever talking in such sort",
        "As you do--far more sadly--he seemed hurt,",
        "Even as a man with his peculiar wrong,",
        "To hear but of the oppression of the strong,",
        "Or those absurd deceits (I think with you",

        "'Alas, what drove him mad?' 'I cannot say:",
